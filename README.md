# ReflexPro
This App is used by Reflexology practitioners to record the Treatments of their clients. It is free to us but you cannot use any part of this for commercial purposes. No selling!
It uses mySQL80 Database. I have added a MySQL Backup which contains the script to create the DB, and then you can restore the Backup to populate Lookup tables with relevant data.
You will find I also use CrystalDecisions, so you will have to download Nuget Packages for this as I created a Crystal Report stored in the ReportDefs folder.
You will also need to download the MySQL Connector Nuget package for this.

I uploaded a video clip of the demo of the App so you can get an idea of how it works.
